    I think this would be a great educational Bitcoin website. It would be a list of about 15 archetypes (such as Banker, Web Designer, Stay-at-home Mom, Factory Worker, etc...). 
     
    When you click on each one, you'd get a brief customized tutorial/overview that matches your vocabulary and interests.
     
    Bitcoin can be explained in so many ways to so many different people, so why don't we start doing it that way?
     
    Does anything like this already exist?

    We could start an open source effort and host it on GitHub pages?

    |   No, results are all that matter he wouldn't post it publicly if this was a concern.

    It'd be extremely useful for people who are, for instance, immigrants attempting to send money back home. Or small businesses that sell things online.
     
    But it's hard to see how it'd be useful for things any more specific than that.

    I've got a project in the beta stage along those lines. Not ready for launch yet, but here is a preview. I'd love to get feedback: http://www.sowhatsbitcoin.com/

    |   I think it's great! It's a really nice approachable bird's eye view.

    |   You might also want to mention Coinbase for merchants. I use them for http://bitcoinmegaphone.com and have been relatively happy.

    This is a genius idea only because it'd be the funniest thing in history to watch a bitcoiner try to write to a stay at home mom or banker or factory worker about their vocabulary and interests.

    |   You know how your kids are unique and there are no other kids exactly the same as them? Think of you bitcoin addresses as your kids. Unique and cannot be duplicated.
    |   
    |   ...
    |   
    |   You know how your kids goes to school and trades their banana for a Snack Pack? Think of it as a transferring bitcoins from one address to another.

    |   |   Whats cute about your comment is that these are like the last thing they care about. not sure if you did that on purpose or not.

    |   "Hi fellow mom. Don't you love your kids? Know what else you should love? Bitcoin..."
    |   
    |   Really though, the best way to do it would be to enlist freelance writers who actually fit the demographic for each category.
